# Gender Inequality quiz

## Introduction
The quiz is an interactive quiz about gender inequality, consisting of ten questions, each with three answer options. Once a user selects an option, they will receive instant feedback through color indicators on the options. If the chosen option is correct, it will turn green; if it is incorrect, it will turn red. If the user selects the wrong answer, not only will the chosen option turn red, but the other options will also turn red for wrong answers and green for the right answer. This provides users with immediate information on what the correct answer should be and helps them learn the facts.

At the end of the quiz, when the user has answered all the questions, the result, including the number of correct answers, will be displayed. Users have the option to create a username, which will be shown on the first page along with the quiz result. They can also choose to retake the quiz for a better result by clicking on the "Retake Quiz" button, which will take them back to the first question, or they can quit the game by clicking on the "Quit" button and return to the first page.

## Target user
The target audience for this quiz is anyone who wants to assess their understanding of gender inequality and, by taking the quiz, acquire additional knowledge on the topic.
